Feature: Recovery Method API
  Messages are exchanged with a RESTful API for the
  purpose of creating and verifying password recovery
  methods.

  Background:
    Given the requester is authorized
    And the user store is empty
    And I add a user with an "employee_id" of "123"

  Scenario: Retrieve Method records for a User without any Method records
    When I request "/user/123/method" be retrieved
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And I should receive 0 records

  Scenario: Retrieve Method records for a User with 1 Method record
    Given user with employee id 123 has a verified Method "email@example.com"
    When I request "/user/123/method" be retrieved
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And I should receive 1 record

  Scenario: Retrieve Method records for a User with 1 verified and 1 unverified Method
    Given user with employee id 123 has a verified Method "email1@example.com"
    And user with employee id 123 has an unverified Method "email2@example.com"
    When I request "/user/123/method" be retrieved
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And I should receive 2 records

  Scenario: Retrieve a specific Method record
    Given user with employee id 123 has a verified Method "email@example.com"
    When I send a "GET" to "/method/{uid}" with a valid uid
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the following data is returned:
      | property      | value                 |
      | value         | email@example.com  |

  Scenario: Create a new Method record
    When I provide the following valid data:
      | property     | value                 |
      | employee_id  | 123                   |
      | value        | user123@example.org   |
    And I request "/method/create" be created
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the following data is returned:
      | property      | value                 |
      | value         | user123@example.org   |
    And a method record exists with a value of "user123@example.org"
    And the following method data should be stored:
      | property              | value                 |
      | value                 | user123@example.org   |
      | verified              | 0                     |
      | verification_attempts | 1                     |
#    And verification_code should be stored as ?
#    And verification_expires should be stored as ? UTC
#    And created should be stored as now UTC

### TODO: Try to create a method using the primary (or spouse/supervisor) address

  Scenario: Resend a method verification
    Given user with employee id 123 has an unverified Method "unverified@example.com"
    When I send a "PUT" to "/method/{uid}/resend" with a valid uid
    Then the response status code should be 204
    And a method record exists with a value of "unverified@example.com"
    And the following method data should be stored:
      | property              | value                 |
      | verified              | 0                     |

  Scenario: Verify a Method
    Given user with employee id 123 has an unverified Method "unverified@example.com"
    And I do not provide an employee_id
    When I send the correct code to verify that Method
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the following data is returned:
      | property      | value                    |
      | value         | unverified@example.com   |
    And a method record exists with a value of "unverified@example.com"
    And the following method data should be stored:
      | property              | value                 |
      | verified              | 1                     |
      | verification_code     | null                  |
      | verification_attempts | null                  |
      | verification_expires  | null                  |

  Scenario: Delete a Method
    Given user with employee id 123 has an unverified Method "email@example.com"
    When I send a "DELETE" to "/method/{uid}" with a valid uid
    Then the response status code should be 204

  Scenario: Verify a Method with expired verification code
    Given user with employee id 123 has an unverified Method "unverified@example.com"
    And the verification expiration time has passed
    And I do not provide an employee_id
    When I send the correct code to verify that Method
    Then the response status code should be 410
    And a method record exists with a value of "unverified@example.com"
    And the method should remain unverified
    And the verification should not be expired
    And the verification attempts counter should be 1
    And the verification code should have changed

  Scenario: Verify a Method with expired verification code and incorrect code
    Given user with employee id 123 has an unverified Method "unverified@example.com"
    And the verification expiration time has passed
    And I do not provide an employee_id
    When I send an incorrect code to verify that Method
    Then the response status code should be 400
    And a method record exists with a value of "unverified@example.com"
    And the method should remain unverified
    And the verification should be expired
    And the verification attempts counter should be 1
    And the verification code should not have changed

  Scenario: Verify a Method with an incorrect code
    Given user with employee id 123 has an unverified Method "unverified@example.com"
    And I do not provide an employee_id
    When I send an incorrect code to verify that Method
    Then the response status code should be 400
    And a method record exists with a value of "unverified@example.com"
    And the method should remain unverified
    And the verification should not be expired
    And the verification attempts counter should be 1
